Sure, it’s totally usable, but it never really feels like you’re fully in control. If you drag an app across the iPad’s screen, for example, the icon will dance around your finger a bit as the display tries its best to keep up. That's not good enough for Dietz and his team, as they have whipped up a demo of how things ought to be — unlike the 100ms delay of a regular touchscreen, the demo knocks that delay between touch and tracking down to 1ms flat.""}]","[{'title': 'clicOH’s shipping technology provides Amazon-like logistics to e-commerce companies in LatAm', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/23/clicoh-e-commerce-latam-amazon-logistics/', 'date': 'May 23, 2022', 'category': 'Enterprise', 'author': 'Christine Hall', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Juan-Altamirano_Agustin-Novillo-Saravia_Emiliano-Segura.jpg?w=660', 'excerpt': 'clicOH delivers a package every 20 seconds and services customers of all sizes, from AB inBev and Red Bull to small Shopify merchants.'}, {'title': 'Colgate-Palmolive, Coca-Cola and Unilever join AB InBev’s sustainable supply chain accelerator', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/22/colgate-palmolive-coca-cola-and-unilever-join-ab-inbevs-sustainable-supply-chain-accelerator/', 'date': 'Apr 22, 2021', 'category': 'Startups', 'author': 'Jonathan Shieber', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/GettyImages-851240200.jpg?w=552', 'excerpt': ""A clutch of the world's largest consumer products and food companies are joining Budweiser's parent company Anheuser-Busch InBev in backing an investment""}, {'title': 'From beer waste to ‘plastic’ packaging, Mi Terro downs $1.5M to make the world more biodegradable', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/2022/03/04/me-terro-seed-funding/', 'date': 'Mar 4, 2022', 'category': 'Hardware', 'author': 'Haje Jan Kamps', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/avocado-film-e1646411422636.jpg?w=665', 'excerpt': 'A shrewd entrepreneur joins the 100+ accelerator program sponsored by brewing giant AB Inbev and home consumables emporium Unilever, and spots a pattern.'}, {'title': 'EA response to ‘Battlefront II’ complaint is the most downvoted comment in Reddit history', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/2017/11/13/ea-response-to-battlefront-ii-complaint-is-the-most-downvoted-comment-in-reddit-history/', 'date': 'Nov 13, 2017', 'category': 'Media & Entertainment', 'author': 'Lucas Matney', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/14battlefront.jpg?w=610', 'excerpt': 'Just as many people enjoy a nice cold Goose Island pale ale but hate the beer megacorp AB InBev which owns it, so too is the rage palpable against Electronic Arts, which owns many a beloved franchise but is far less than the sum of its parts.

That\'s what Blake Williams has come to realize in the months following Keepsy\'s launch. You may recall back in December of last year, the startup launched as a way to create tangible photo albums with all of your friends using Facebook. It\'s a good idea. But again, there\'s a barrier to entry. So now Keepsy has a new product to alleviate that problem. ""Instant Albums"" hooks into your Instagram pictures via their API and in seconds build you a complete photo album. Once you give them your Instagram credentials, Keepsy pulls in what it considers to be your 35 (or so) best pictures and organizes them for you into this book.'}, {'title': 'Keepsy: A Photo Album Made By A Friend Is Cool.

Sure, just about all of the major sites allow you to order prints, and many allow you to create fairly simple photobooks, but those are essentially the same products they\'ve always been — they\'re just slightly easier to make. Keepsy wants to change things up. The new startup founded by\xa0Peter Weck and Blake Williams, focuses on creating ""more than a photo album."" Essentially, they use the social dynamics of the web to crowdsource the creation of photo albums amongst friends. So instead of me making a photo album for you filled with the pictures I have with the two of us in them, a group of friends bring all their pictures together to make the book.'}]","[{'title': 'iPhone to be the best phone in all of China', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/17/iphone-to-be-the-best-phone-in-all-of-china/', 'date': 'Nov 17, 2009', 'category': 'Media & Entertainment', 'author': 'John Biggs', 'image': 'N/A', 'excerpt': ""China Unicom's chairman believes that the iPhone will be the most popular phone in China, beating out Nokia and RIM for the crown of Bounteous Emperor of""}]","[{'title': 'BrainStation expands online coding bootcamps to meet surge in demand', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/sponsor/brainstation/brainstation-expands-online-coding-bootcamps-to-meet-surge-in-demand/', 'date': 'May 13, 2020', 'category': 'Sponsored', 'author': 'Laura Safran', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Hero-Image.jpg?w=562', 'excerpt': ''}]","[{'title': '1001Pharmacies Grabs $8.9 Million To Bring Your Pharmacy To The Web', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/2015/07/09/1001pharmacies-grabs-8-9-million-to-bring-your-pharmacy-to-the-web/', 'date': 'Jul 9, 2015', 'category': 'Startups', 'author': 'Romain Dillet', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/12661854024_2861af40b8_o.jpg?w=502', 'excerpt': 'French startup 1001Pharmacies just raised $8.9 million (€8 million) from Newfund, CM-CIC Capital Privé, and business angels, such as Xaviel Niel, Pierre'}, {'title': 'Creads Raises $4.1 Million To Fuel International Growth', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/2014/04/02/creads-raises-4-1-million-to-fuel-international-growth/', 'date': 'Apr 2, 2014', 'category': 'Startups', 'author': 'Romain Dillet', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/creads-credit-france-digitale-5.jpg?w=563', 'excerpt': 'French startup Creads raised $4.1 million (€3 million) from CM-CIC Capital Privé.

When I asked about this, Cindy admitted that she'd only seen the sequel two days prior to our interview, and that it was like going to the prom without a date. She made a small cameo in Sam Flynn's room on his poster and that was about it. Cindy is incredibly gracious though, understanding that movie producers have to make difficult decisions.

Spivack originally published it on Twine, and it is republished here with his permission. Some of the sections have been rearranged for clarity. Stephen Wolfram is building something new -- and it is really impressive and significant. In fact it may be as important for the Web (and the world) as Google, but for a different purpose. Stephen was kind enough to spend two hours with me last week to demo his new online service -- Wolfram Alpha (scheduled to open in May). In the course of our conversation we took a close look at Wolfram Alpha\'s capabilities, discussed where it might go, and what it means for the Web, and even the Semantic Web. Stephen has not released many details of his project publicly yet, so I will respect that and not give a visual description of exactly what I saw. However, he has revealed it a bit in a recent article, and so below I will give my reactions to what I saw and what I think it means. And from that you should be able to get at least some idea of the power of this new system. A Computational Knowledge Engine for the Web In a nutshell, Wolfram and his team have built what he calls a ""computational knowledge engine"" for the Web. OK, so what does that really mean? Basically it means that you can ask it factual questions and it computes answers for you. It doesn\'t simply return documents that (might) contain the answers, like Google does, and it isn\'t just a giant database of knowledge, like the Wikipedia. It doesn\'t simply parse natural language and then use that to retrieve documents, like Powerset, for example. Instead, Wolfram Alpha actually computes the answers to a wide range of questions -- like questions that have factual answers such as ""What country is Timbuktu in?"" or ""How many protons are in a hydrogen atom?"" or ""What is the average rainfall in Seattle?""'}]","[{'title': 'LocalVox Launches Full-Service Marketing Solution To Help Local Merchants Target Their Customers', 'link': 'https://techcrunch.com/2011/11/28/localvox-launches-full-service-marketing-solution-to-help-local-merchants-target-their-customers/', 'date': 'Nov 28, 2011', 'category': 'Startups', 'author': 'Rip Empson', 'image': 'https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/139187v2-max-250x250.jpg?w=150', 'excerpt': 'Hyperlocal is all the rage these days, and content companies, deal sites, and everyone in between are trying to find better ways to access (and advertise to) local markets.
